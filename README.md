# Pre-work - *Let's Tip*

**Let's Tip** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Keltoum Laghjibi**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Created a Second View Controller
- [X] connected a button to the second view controller and another button to return to the previous view controller
- [X] Built in a textfield that would allow the user to insert their own whole number value that will represent a tip percentage
- [X] Created a button that leads to random tip generator on the second screen
- [X] Created a button that when pressed would generate a random tip value between 8 and 20 (this can then be used on the first view controller in the textfield to calculate the tip and total amount)

## Notes

I had several issues programmed the random generator on swift
I had some issues with my font showing up when I used a custom one so I stuck with the standard system font
I would constantly receive an error when I tried programming my second view controller but this error was fixed when I retraced my steps and tried a new approach
